#+TITLE: Go Advent of Code

This repository collects my answers to all advent of code problems available. I do not claim that these are the best, or the fastest answers to all problems, but I try for them to be clean and readable, unlike some code-golf-like solutions. Some of these will compute instantly, others will take some time, but given the nature of challenges, and them being mostly done for fun, doing optimizations seem to be mostly obsolete.
