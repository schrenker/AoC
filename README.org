#+TITLE: Go Advent of Code ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ⭐⭐⭐

Since I adopted an antipattern to throw bunch of functions into one single package, I decided to get rid of previous years, tools and other stuff and start fresh.

There are branches y2022 and y2015, but they will probably be replaced.

* Usage
go-task is used to generate all boilerplate data, and to run tasks. All 'YEAR' parameters acces 4 digit year. DAY accepts 2 digit day. Part accepts one of: [1,01,2,02]
#+begin_src bash
task gen -- YEAR DAY          # Generates day file, along with it's test file and benchmark file.
task run -- YEAR DAY PART     # Runs given challenge.
task new1                     # Run latest generated day, part one.
task new2                     # Run latest generated day, part two.

task bench -- YEAR DAY [PART] # Run benchmarks for a given day, with optional PART parameter.
task bnew1                    # Run benchmarks for latest generated day, part one.
task bnew2                    # Run benchmarks for latest generated day, part two.
task benchAll                 # Run all benchmarks, for all days, for all years.

task test -- YEAR DAY [PART]  # Run test for given day, with optional PART parameter.
task tnew1                    # Run tests for latest generated day, part one.
task tnew2                    # Run tests for latest generated day, part two.
task testAll                  # Run all tests, for all days, for all years.
